README for Net::Whois Version 1.0
#	$Id: README,v 1.2 1999/07/25 03:17:40 dhudes Exp $	


This is a Perl 5 module that retrieves and parses information from the
'whois' databases. Currently, only domains .com, .edu, .net are supported.
Forthcoming versions will support .mil, .gov, .arpa, and eventually other top-level domains. Additional classes to get POC/Handle, Host, and all the other
things stored in the ARIN and 'InterNIC' whois databases and eventually
the RIPE and others as well.

If you are behind a firewall, you may not  be able to use this module.

See the documentation in Whois.pm for instructions on how to use it.

Note that the Locale::Country module (part of the Locale-Codes
distribution) is used to recognize spelled-out country names; if that
module is not present, only two-letter country abbreviations will be
recognized.

Thanks to Chip for writing the original version of this module.
