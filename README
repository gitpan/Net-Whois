README for Net::Whois Version 0.20

This is a Perl 5 module that retrieves and parses information from the
InterNIC 'whois' database.  If you are behind a firewall, you probably
won't be able to use this module.

This version supports only the information about domains.  Future work
may include information about people and other entities about which
the InterNIC keeps data.

See the documentation in Whois.pm for instructions on how to use it.

Note that the Locale::Country module (part of the Locale-Codes
distribution) is used to recognize spelled-out country names; if that
module is not present, only two-letter country abbreviations will be
recognized.

Thanks to Idle Communications (idle.com) for sponsoring this software
and providing the perl.org domain.
