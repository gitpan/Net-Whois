This is a Perl 5 module that retrieves and parses information from the
InterNIC 'whois' database.  If you are behind a firewall, you probably
won't be able to use this module.

This version supports only the information about domains.  Future work
may include information about people and other entities about which
the InterNIC keeps data.

See the documentation in Whois.pm for instructions on how to use it.
